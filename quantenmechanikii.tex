%% ADPS TEMPLATE v0.2
%
%% Author: Adrian Nievergelt
%% Created: Mai of 2008
%
%% Description:
%% 
%% This template was created for two reasons. The first one is to provide a more
%% unified look for all documents published. The second reason is to provide a
%% default set of ready to use commands to help authors save time on individual
%% customizations that usually everyone will do anyway after some time.
%
%% This Template is the result of a rather long process of changes that started
%% long before the ADPS itself was written and proviedes the experience of
%% several authors, including me to people who are inexperied in mathematical
%% typesetting.

%% We use the memoir class because it offers a many easy to use features.
\documentclass[10pt,a5paper,twoside]{memoir}

%% Packages ====================================================================

%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
\usepackage[english]{babel}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.
%% \usepackage[sc]{mathpazo}
%% Computer Roman is a very nice and clean font and there is no reason to change this.

%% OPTIONAL: This is needed to generate an index at the end of the
%% document.
%\usepackage{makeidx}

%% Make document internal hyperlinks whereever possible. (TOC, references)
\usepackage{hyperref}

%% Math related packages

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts,mathrsfs}

%% NTheorem is a reimplementation of the AMS Theorem package. This will allow
%% us to typeset theorems like examples, proofs and similar.
%% NOTE: Must be loaded AFTER amsmath, or the \qed placement will break
\usepackage[thmmarks]{ntheorem}
